Data Analysis in Python
# The Notebook: Exploring Movies Dataset
# Introduction
Welcome to "The Notebook" - an exploration of a movies dataset! In this notebook, we will use Python and the pandas library to analyze various aspects of movies. The dataset contains information about movie titles, genres, IMDb scores, budgets, and more.

# Data Preparation
In this section, we perform data preparation steps to ensure our analysis is accurate and relevant. We remove unnecessary columns, convert data types, and rename columns to make them more meaningful. To begin with, we load the dataset, which is in JSON format, using the pandas library.Once the dataset is loaded, we take a quick look at its contents and display the first few rows to get an idea of the data. We also check the shape of the dataset to see the number of movies and attributes it contains. This dataset contains information about different movies, such as their titles, genres, IMDb scores, budgets, and more. Next, we perform some data preparation steps. We remove unnecessary columns that are not relevant to our analysis, such as the IMDb links and the number of critic reviews. We also convert the data type of the "title_year" column to integers for better analysis. To make the column names more meaningful, we rename some of them. For example, we change "gross" to "Movie_Income" and "budget" to "movie_budget".

# Data Analysis
Movie Duration and IMDb Scores
Moving on to data analysis, we start by visualizing the distribution of movie durations and IMDb scores using histograms. These histograms give us insights into the range and frequency of different durations and IMDb scores.

Next, we explore the IMDb scores of movies based on their country of production. We create histograms to analyze the IMDb scores of movies produced in the USA and Canada separately. This helps us understand the distribution and trends of IMDb scores in different countries.

We also analyze the movie budgets of black and white films. By creating a histogram, we observe the budget distribution specifically for black and white movies.

In addition to these visual analyses, we answer some analytical questions about the dataset. For example, we identify the years with the highest and lowest numbers of movies using line charts. We also determine the years with the highest and lowest average IMDb scores.

To understand any relationship between IMDb scores and movie income, we create a scatter plot. This plot allows us to visualize if there is any correlation between these two variables.

Furthermore, we investigate which country has the highest average IMDb score based on the available data. We display a bar chart to showcase the average IMDb scores for different countries.

# Analytical Questions
We answer several analytical questions based on the dataset:

1. Identifying the years with the highest and lowest numbers of movies using line charts.
2. Determining the years with the highest and lowest average IMDb scores, helping us understand the trends over time.
3. Investigating any relationship between IMDb scores and movie income by creating a scatter plot.
4. Identifying the country with the highest average IMDb score based on the available data using a bar chart.
5. Counting the number of colored and black-and-white movies in the dataset.
# Conclusion
By exploring and analyzing this movies dataset, we gain valuable insights into different aspects of movies, such as their durations, IMDb scores, budgets, and geographical factors. The visualizations and analyses presented here help us understand trends, distributions, and relationships within the data.
